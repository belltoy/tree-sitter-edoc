# tree-sitter-edoc

_A tree-sitter grammar for the Erlang documentation generator (edoc) syntax_

### Status

`tree-sitter-edoc` is not very complete - it's usable but not very good yet.
Some improvements to do:

* Tags may only start on line beginnings
* Macros may break on lines
* XHTML injections aren't working yet
